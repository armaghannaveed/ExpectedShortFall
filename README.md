# ExpectedShortFall
Expected Shortfall Summary
Summary:
Expected Shortfall (ES), also known as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), is a risk measure that estimates the expected loss in a given time period, given that the loss exceeds a certain threshold (usually a quantile of the loss distribution). It is considered a more coherent risk measure than Value at Risk (VaR) because it takes into account the tail risk of the loss distribution.

Variables:
To calculate Expected Shortfall, you need the following variables:

1. Loss distribution: The distribution of potential losses for your portfolio or investment.
2. Confidence level (α): The probability level at which you want to estimate the risk. Commonly used confidence levels are 95% or 99%.

Formula
Here's the formula to calculate Expected Shortfall:

ES(α) = (1 / (1 - α)) * ∫[α, 1] VaR(p) dp

where:
- ES(α) is the Expected Shortfall at the α confidence level
- VaR(p) is the Value at Risk at probability level p
- ∫[α, 1] denotes the integral from α to 1

To calculate Expected Shortfall, follow these steps:

1. Determine the loss distribution for your portfolio or investment. This can be done using historical data, Monte Carlo simulations, or other methods.
2. Choose a confidence level (α) for which you want to estimate the risk.
3. Calculate the Value at Risk (VaR) for each probability level (p) between α and 1.
4. Integrate the VaR values over the range [α, 1] and divide by (1 - α) to obtain the Expected Shortfall.

Keep in mind that calculating Expected Shortfall can be computationally intensive, especially for large portfolios or complex loss distributions. In practice, many financial institutions and risk managers use software tools or specialized algorithms to compute Expected Shortfall efficiently.

Approaches

Historical Simulation: This method involves collecting historical data and ranking them from worst to best. The ES is then calculated as the average of the worst losses that are beyond the VaR point.

2. Monte Carlo Simulation: This method involves generating a large number of random portfolio paths, calculating the portfolio loss at the end of each path, and then determining the average loss of the worst-case scenarios.

3. Parametric Method: This method involves fitting a statistical distribution to the data (often a normal or t-distribution), and then calculating the expected value of the tail of the distribution beyond the VaR point.

4. Delta-Normal Method: This method involves calculating the ES based on the sensitivity of the portfolio's value to changes in the underlying risk factors, combined with the standard deviation of those risk factors.

Explanation: This method is a type of parametric approach that is used when the portfolio consists of linear derivatives. The Delta-Normal Method calculates the ES based on the sensitivity (delta) of the portfolio's value to changes in the underlying risk factors.
The delta of a portfolio is a measure of how much portfolio is expected to change due to a small change in the value of the underlying asset. This method assumes that changes in the value of the underlying asset are normally distributed.
To calculate the ES using the Delta-Normal Method, we first calculate the portfolio's delta. We then use this delta to adjust the mean and standard deviation of the underlying asset's returns. The ES is then calculated as the expected value of the tail of this adjusted distribution beyond the VaR point.


5. Delta-Gamma Method: This method is an extension of the Delta-Normal method that also into account the curvature of the price function of the portfolio. The ES is then calculated based on this adjusted distribution.

Explanation:
This method is an extension of the Delta-Normal method that also takes into account the curvature (gamma) of the price function of the portfolio. The gamma of a portfolio is a measure of how much the delta of the portfolio is expected to change due to a small change in the value of the underlying asset.
The Delta-Gamma Method is used when the portfolio consists of non-linear derivatives, as it can capture the effects of changes in the delta on the value of the portfolio.
To calculate the ES using the Delta-Gamma Method, we first calculate the portfolio's delta and gamma. We then use these to adjust the mean and standard deviation of the underlying asset's returns. The ES is then calculated as the expected value of the tail of this adjusted distribution beyond the VaR point.
This method provides a more accurate estimate of the ES for portfolios with non-linear derivatives, but it is also more complex and computationally intensive than the Delta-Normal Method.

6. Factor Push Method: This method involves changing one factor at a time while keeping all other factors constant to see the effect on the portfolio value. The ES is then calculated as the average of the worst losses resulting from these changes.

7. Cornish-Fisher Expansion: This method involves adjusting the normal distribution used in the Delta-Normal method to account for skewness and kurtosis in the data. The ES is then calculated based on this adjusted distribution.

8. Quadratic Programming: This method involves solving a quadratic programming problem to calculate the ES. This is often used when calculating the ES of a portfolio with a large number of assets. TOO COMPLEX

9. Fourier Transform Methods: These methods involve using Fourier transforms to calculate the ES. These are often used when distribution is not known or is difficult to calculate directly.

This approach doesn’t require the calculation of a return distribution. Instead, it uses Fourier transformations and an exponential smoothing (exponential weighted moving average) algorithm to calculate volatility on a time-series basis. It then uses complex mathematics to calculate an expected shortfall.
